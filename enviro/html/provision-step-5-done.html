      <h2>Awesome &ndash; we're done here!</h2>
      <p>
        Your board is configured and ready to rock. All that's left to do is reset your board so that it can start gathering data.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once reset your board will enter data gathering mode.

        <input type="hidden" name="provisioned" value="True" />

      <h2>If you need to setup your board again.</h2>
      <p>
        If you want to use this setup tool again then you can get back into it
        by following these steps:        
        <ul>
          <li>Hold down the <code>POKE</code> button &ndash; the one on the front with the <span style="font-size: 2.4rem; position: relative; top: 0.4rem;">&#x261E;</span> icon.</li>
          <li>Press and release the <code>RESET</code> button (on the back).</li>
          <li>Keep <code>POKE</code> held down for three more seconds.</li>
          <li>The activity <span style="font-size: 2.0rem; position: relative; top: 0.2rem;">&#9872;</span>  LED will start to flash.</li>
          <li>The board will go into access point mode and appear as a WiFi network to connect to.</li>
          <li>Connect to the board using your phone, laptop, stone circle, or tablet.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <br>
      <h2>Advanced mode: manually editing your configuration.</h2>
      <p>
        All the questions we asked during setup were a convenient way to generate your boards' 
        configuration file.
      </p>
      <p>
        In future if you want to quickly tweak a setting without going through process again 
        you can simply edit <code>config.py</code> using a tool like <strong>Thonny</strong> 
        and then reset your board to apply the change.
